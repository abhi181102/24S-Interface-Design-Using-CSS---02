          <!-- Lyrics content -->
          <h2>Faded</h2>
          <p>
            [Verse 1] You were the shadow to my light<br />
            Did you feel us? Another star, you fade away<br />
            Afraid our aim is out of sight<br />
            Wanna see us alight
          </p>

          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus] Where are you now?<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Was it all in my fantasy?<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Were you only imaginary?
          </p>

          <p>
            [Chorus] Where are you now?<br />
            Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Another dream<br />
            The monster's running wild inside of me<br />
            I'm faded, I'm faded<br />
            So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded<br />
            So lost, I'm faded
          </p>

          <p>
            [Verse 2] These shallow waters never met what I needed<br />
            I'm letting go, a deeper dive<br />
            Eternal silence of the sea<br />
            I'm breathing, alive
          </p>

          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus] Where are you now?<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Under the bright but faded lights<br />
            You set my heart on fire<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Where are you now?
          </p>

          <p>
            [Chorus] Where are you now?<br />
            Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea<br />
            Where are you now?<br />
            Another dream<br />
            The monster's running wild inside of me<br />
            I'm faded, I'm faded<br />
            So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded<br />
            So lost, I'm faded
