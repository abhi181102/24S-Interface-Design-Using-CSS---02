          <p>
            We're the sock to your Dobby, the ring to your Gollum, the Jarvis to
            your Iron Man, the people's elbow to your The Rock, the red
            underwear to your Superman, the Chandler to your Joey, the Luke to
            your Leia, the Bamm-Bamm to your Pebbles... we could go on. We're
            here to celebrate fandom with all of you, by bringing to you
            official merchandise of your favourite Hollywood movies, TV shows,
            sports teams, comedians, and musicians, with a wide range of kickass
            graphic designs on all your favourite products.

        <h2>Why we're called 'The Souled Store'</h2>
        <p>
          For starters, it makes for a great pun on the word 'sold', since we
          'sell' stuff. Smart, right? But more importantly, The Souled Store was
          born out of the idea of loving what you do - “following your soul”.
          Our philosophy is that life is short. Don't spend it doing something
          you don't like. There are too many Monday mornings, and you can't go
          dreading every single one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We, at The Souled Store, love what we do- designs, products,
          marketing, and everything in between. Our goal is to give everyone
          something they'll love, something they can use to express themselves,
          and, simply put, something to put a smile on their face. So, whether
          it's superheroes, TV shows, pop culture, music, sports, or quirky,
          funny stuff you're looking for, we have something for everyone.
          Because each person is a special snowflake (whether or not they
          believe it), and they deserve only the most insane merchandise
          available out there! So, if you relate to the feeling, and believe in
          following one's heart (soul), hop along on this wonderful journey of
          ours, and help us spread the love!

          <h2>We are your favourite, online store.</h2>
          <p>
            We create and curate stunning designs and print them on all sorts of
            equally stunning products- from t-shirts to phone covers to
            backpacks to boxers to mugs to socks to badges to pins to hoodies
            and many, many more! Our funky products are designed and printed
            specifically to spread happiness, right down to the bottom of your
            'soul'. A recent study by our internal, self-funded, fashion forward
            (and totally unbiased) team showed that if you buy from
            www.thesouledstore.com, it increases your lifespan by 7.5%. So if
            you're looking for great products, with even greater deals and
            discounts, you've come to the right place!
